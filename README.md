# Web components boilerplate project with Preact

This project uses Preact to generate reusable web components and bundles them in a file using Webpack.

The idea behind this is to have a starting point for any project that uses web components. You would develop them into a project like this one, then use the transpiled, pollyfilled bundle created in the `dist/` folder into a production environment.

## Usage

### Initial setup

```sh
$ npm i
```

### Dev server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Production build

```sh
$ npm run build
```
